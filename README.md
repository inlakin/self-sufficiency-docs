# Les Docs de l'Autonomie

Website build on top of the [angular-filemanager](https://github.com/joni2back/angular-filemanager)

The goal is to share and exchange documents regarding ways of being autonomous in life (permaculture, self-sufficiency ...).

At first, I will only provide the docs I have and then, the possibility of uploading file from visitors will come. (need to implement security check first and users management)
